* Multiple top-level exploration windows.  Use 'n' to make a new window.

* Tool panels show supplementary information:
  * You Are Here shows your location in the Mandelbrot set.  Use 'l' to show it.
  * Palettes panel shows all the palettes, and the one currently in use.
  * Statistics panel shows statistics about the latest computation.
  * Point Info panel shows information about the current point, shift-hover to indicate point.
  * Julia panel shows Julia set for the current point, shift-hover to indicate point.
    Double-clicking the Julia panel opens a new exploration window to explore that Julia set.
  
* Computation improvements:
  * Faster.
  * The exploration window updates during computation.  
  * Continuous coloring is more accurate now: banding artifacts are gone.
  * When dragging the exploration window, pixels still in the window aren't re-calculated.
  
* Center and diameter can be specified in the command line arguments.
