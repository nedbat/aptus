Aptus 3.0.1, July 25 2021
-------------------------

* Web interface.

Next release (was 2.1, never formally released)
-----------------------------------------------

* Multi-threaded.

* Added full-screen mode.  'f' toggles between full-screen and windowed.

* Window size can be set interactively with the 'w' key.  Enter an explicit size,
  or 's/2' (or s/3, s/4, etc) for half the screen size.

* Un-computed pixels are shown as gray checkerboard.

* If the view crosses the x-axis, the symmetry is used to speed up computation.

* 'o' opens saved settings or image files (*.aptus or *.png).

* Files can be dropped on the Aptus window to open them.

* The About section of the Help dialog now shows versions of installed
  pre-requisite packages.


Aptus 2.0, October 2008
-----------------------

* Multiple top-level exploration windows.  Use 'n' to make a new window.

* Tool panels show supplementary information:
  * You Are Here shows your location in the Mandelbrot set.  Use 'l' to show it.
  * Palettes panel shows all the palettes, and the one currently in use.
  * Statistics panel shows statistics about the latest computation.
  * Point Info panel shows information about the current point, shift-hover to indicate point.
  * Julia panel shows Julia set for the current point, shift-hover to indicate point.
    Double-clicking the Julia panel opens a new exploration window to explore that Julia set.

* Computation improvements:
  * Faster.
  * The exploration window updates during computation.
  * Continuous coloring is more accurate now: banding artifacts are gone.
  * When dragging the exploration window, pixels still in the window aren't re-calculated.

* Center and diameter can be specified in the command line arguments.
