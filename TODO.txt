- Status bar for progress and stats presentation.
+ Some kind of progress indicator.
- GUI progress indicator.
+ Cycle detection
- HSV palette
- Generalized palette specification
- Reading GIMP gradients as palettes
- Command line invocation (refactor a bunch of stuff)
- Multi-precision floats
- Optimize boundary.py so we can use it for high iterations
- Boundary checking in C
- Stats: what's the census of iteration counts in the image?
- Editable parameters for things like cycle checking epsilon.
- Switchable coloring: standard, cycle count, etc.
- Interruptable rendering: write partial counts to a file and restart.
- Paint partial progress in the window.
- Refactor mandext.c so that it defines a class, rather than having all those globals.
- Make a window icon.
- Faster epsilon comparison for cycle checking (use tricky int operations...)
